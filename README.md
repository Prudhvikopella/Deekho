✅ What’s Done
Pagination with PagingAdapter and PagingSource.
Grid layout with RecyclerView for showing anime.
Used fragments to keep things modular.
Integrated ViewPager2 with TabLayout for switching between categories.
Built everything using Kotlin + XML.
Added all required dependencies.
Icons made using Canva (free version).
Clicking on any anime takes you to a detailed page.

Indicators I Added:
🔹 Blue tick → Marked as “Approved” (though I couldn’t find an exact meaning from the mail/website).
🎬 Video icon → Means YouTube trailer is available.
🔴 Red dot → Anime has finished airing.
🟢 Green dot → Anime is currently airing.
🟡 Yellow dot → Anime is not finished but not airing at the moment.

❌ What’s Left (Due to Time Constraints)
I had some unexpected things come up personally, so a few features didn’t make it in:
Room DB seeding
Filters with sub view holders
UX and performance optimizations
Custom theme based on Seekho
Color palette from the Seekho logo
Constants/global values for reusability
UI polish using the theme/colors

📝 Side Notes
If needed, I can drop a separate NOTES.md with:
How I picked the color palette
My plan for the theme
Filtering and seeding ideas
Design decisions and thought process

⚠️ Final Word
Despite the situation on my side, I did my best to cover the core functionality and submit something clean and working. Given more time, I’d have loved to take it further with proper polish and those missing pieces.

🙏 Thanks again for the opportunity. Looking forward to your feedback!
